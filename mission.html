          <h3>As a member of the UC Berkeley community, you can make a significant impact on the environment by taking simple steps to reduce paper waste and support our cardboard box reusing initiative. Here are some ways you can help:</h3>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 11px;">Donate your cardboard boxes: When our cardboard box reusing centers are up and running, consider donating your unused cardboard boxes. By doing so, you can help us keep perfectly fine cardboard boxes out of recycling centers and landfills, reducing paper waste and mitigating the impact of climate change.</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 11px;">Take what you need from the reuse centers: You can also come to our cardboard box reusing centers and take as many boxes as you need. By doing so, you can minimize the need for cardboard production and keep these perfectly functional boxes in use, reducing paper waste and contributing to sustainable practices.</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 11px;">Consolidate your orders: Whenever possible, try to consolidate your online orders into a single shipment. Most delivery services, such as Amazon and Walmart, offer free shipping options where shoppers can have all their items shipped in one box. This reduces the number of cardboard boxes used and helps reduce paper waste.</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 11px;">Properly dispose of paper and cardboard: While recycling may not be the final solution to paper waste, it is still a crucial step in reducing the impact of paper production on the environment. Make sure you properly recycle any paper or cardboard you are disposing of. This helps conserve energy and save trees from being cut down.</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 11px;">Spread the word: Share our cardboard box reusing initiative with your friends, family, and colleagues. Encourage them to donate their cardboard boxes and to take simple steps to reduce paper waste. Together, we can make a positive impact on the environment and help mitigate the impact of climate change.</li>
        </ul style="font-size: 23px;">
        By taking these simple steps, you can help reduce paper waste, support our cardboard box reusing initiative, and make a positive impact on the environment. Join us in our mission to promote sustainable practices and make a difference in our community.
