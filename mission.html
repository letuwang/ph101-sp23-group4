      <h1>Our Mission!</h1>
      <h2 style="padding-top: 15px">Reduce, <strong>Reuse</strong>, Recycle</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 19px">
        Our mission is to make a positive impact on the environment by reducing
        paper waste in the Berkeley area. Our goal is to promote sustainable
        practices and provide solutions that are accessible to everyone in the
        community.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of our primary focuses is on establishing cardboard box reusing
        centers in key areas, such as the MLK's Amazon Locker Room area and
        residential housing's mailing rooms, to make it more convenient for UC
        Berkeley students, faculty, and staff to recycle and reuse cardboard
        boxes. We believe that by incentivizing the return and recycling of
        packaging materials, we can encourage more people to participate in
        recycling and reusing efforts.

      <p>
        We recognize that overconsumption of paper is one of the major drivers
        of climate change, resulting in greenhouse gas emissions and
        deforestation. Therefore, we aim to work with UC Berkeley, a campus with
        a population of over 40,000 students, faculty, and staff, to reduce
        paper waste. By focusing on UC Berkeley, we can make a significant
        impact on the environment and set an example for other institutions to
        follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the city of Berkeley itself is a relevant geographic area
        to focus on. We plan to work with the city to establish more sustainable
        practices and encourage residents to recycle and reuse paper products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, we can make a difference by reducing paper waste and promoting
        sustainable practices in the Berkeley community.
