      <h1>Who are we?</h1>
      <p>
        We are a group of passionate UC Berkeley students who are committed to promoting sustainable practices and mitigating the impact of climate change. We believe that consumerism is a place where everyone can take matters into their own hands and make a positive impact on the environment. <br><br>

        Our mission is to reduce paper waste in the Bay Area and establish cardboard box reusing centers to keep perfectly functional boxes out of landfills and recycling centers. By doing so, we aim to mitigate the impact of deforestation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, taking important steps towards a brighter, greener future.<br><br>

        We would like to thank our Public Health professors and speakers for providing us with the platform, information, and opportunities to make a positive impact on the environment and raise awareness about sustainability. Our goal is to continue expanding our initiatives and collaborating with like-minded organizations to make a significant impact on the environment.<br><br>

        Join us in our mission to promote sustainable practices and make a positive impact on the environment. Together, we can create a greener, healthier, and more sustainable future for generations to come.
