      <h1 style="padding-bottom: 20px;;">Why is paper-waste such a big deal?!</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          We believe that reusing cardboard boxes is an essential part of
          reducing paper waste and mitigating the impact of climate change.
          Currently, packaging material and boxes are the highest consumed form
          of paper, and most people throw away or recycle perfectly usable boxes
          after receiving a package. This inefficient cycle adds up, resulting
          in significant amounts of paper waste and contributing to greenhouse
          gas emissions.<br /><br />

          Our solution to this problem is to establish cardboard box reusing
          centers in key areas, such as near the MLK's Amazon Locker Room area
          and in residential housing's mailing rooms. By incentivizing the
          return and recycling of packaging materials, we can encourage more
          people to participate in recycling and reusing efforts. This solution
          is more efficient and cost-effective than general recycling, which has
          high associated costs.<br /><br />

          Our solution not only reduces paper waste but also helps to mitigate
          the impact of deforestation, which is a significant contributor to
          climate change. The primary production of paper involves cutting down
          trees, and reducing paper waste means that fewer trees need to be cut
          down, leading to less deforestation and a reduction in greenhouse gas
          emissions.<br /><br />

          Our solution also offers a practical and accessible way for people to
          make a positive impact on the environment. By providing designated
          spots for cardboard boxes in trash rooms in residential halls and
          similar places, people who need boxes for shipping or moving can
          extend the use of those boxes, avoiding the need to buy new ones.<br /><br />

          Overall, we believe that our solution of establishing cardboard box
          reusing centers and incentivizing the return and recycling of
          packaging materials is an effective and practical way to reduce paper
          waste and mitigate the impact of climate change. Join us in our
          mission to promote sustainable practices and make a positive impact on
          the environment.
