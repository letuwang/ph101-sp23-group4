        <h2>Paper is not the solution</h2>
        <p>
          The impact of paper waste on climate change is significant due to
          several reasons. Firstly, paper waste constitutes a staggering 26% of
          the total waste present in landfills, which in turn contributes to air
          pollution. Additionally, the primary production of paper involves
          cutting down trees, leading to deforestation, which has adverse
          effects on the environment and contributes to global warming.
          Therefore, reducing paper waste is crucial in mitigating the negative
          effects of climate change.
